#### 1. Examine the tree command. Master the technique of applying a template, for example, display all files that contain a character c, or files that contain a specific sequence of characters. List subdirectories of the root directory up to and including the second nesting level.

#### 2. What command can be used to determine the type of file (for example, text orbinary)? Give an example.
```angular2html
file [filename]
```
![task1_2_2](images/task1_2_2.png)
#### 3. Master the skills of navigating the file system using relative and absolute paths. How can you go back to your home directory from anywhere in the filesystem?
```angular2html
~ - home directory (/home/username)
cd                - go to home dir
cd ~              - go to home dir
cd /home/username - go to home dir, using absolute path
cd ..             - go up 1 level dir
cd ../..          - go up 2 levels dir
```
#### 4. Become familiar with the various options for the ls command. Give examples of listing directories using different keys. Explain the information displayed on the terminal using the -l and -a switches.
```angular2html
ls -a   show all files and directories (including hiding, starting with dot)
ls -l   show long format, including access rights, owner, group, size, date of modify
```
